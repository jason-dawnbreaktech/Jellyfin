Hello! Welcome to the beginning of your journey, where you will liberate yourself from the deadly clutches of Netflix, HBO, and Amazon prime! 

Jellyfin is a flexible open source media server that can be installed on a multitude of OS's. Today, we will be installing it on Docker using Docker compose. 

First step is to install Docker on your operating system of choice. My Proxmox box is MIA, so I'll be using an old Windows laptop as the "server" for deployment.
The Compose may need to be modified depending on your OS but the same basic principles will apply.

The Docker Compose provided by jellyfin is a good framework, and with a bit of editing our media server will be up in no time.
